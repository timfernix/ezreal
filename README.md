## Why this exists

Over recent years I have been collecting more and more Ezreal media. So i thought: Why not create this archive to make it easy for other fans to search and view Ezreal media without digging through scattered sources. It includes a clean gallery, filters, search and the possibilty to access the raw assets.

## Contributing

Found missing official art, a higher-res splash, or a WR/TFT/LotR variant that should be here?

Open an **Issue** describing what’s missing (skin, type, tags, and where it appears).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure its official art and not from outside of Riot Games or fanmade, as I dont have the rights to use others creations.
